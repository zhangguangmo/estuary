***** Deploy on the P660 EVB Board *****

1. Purpose
================

  This document describes how to build some files by Estuary tools v0.3, and
  also record the process of booting EVB board using those files.


2. Preparative
================

* Build FTP server in local host 

  We need to build FTP server in local host to communicate with P660 EVB board
  whatever the system of local host is Windows or Ubuntu. For Ubuntu system it
  can download, compile and burn codes directly, but for Windows system it needs
  another server which is linux to compile source codes at first, and then
  transfer it to local host. 

  If local host system is Windows, what we should do is to set names and
  passwords of user, and directory of sharing files after installing software
  wftp32.  


3. Deploying
================
 
(1)	Acquire the source codes of Estuary tools v0.3, these steps are as follow: 

(2)	Run the scripts build.sh to build files we need 

	./tools/build.sh –p EVB –d OpenEmbedded 

	Note: EVB is the platform that can run those built files, and OpenEmbedded
          is the distribution which will run on EVB board.

	After that there is a folder named build on current directory, and a
	folder named EVB in build folder. Under the EVB folder there are file
	folders: distro, linux, toolchain, uefi. The distribution is under the
	distro, compiled source codes of kernel lay under the linux, cross-compiled
	toolchain is under the toolchain, PV660_EFI_L1_EVBa_TC.fd is under the ufei.  

(3) Burn the files into the EVB board and boot up

	Firstly, you should copy the files produced in the last part into the
	directory of the ftp sever. Then to burn these files, you can use the
	following commands.

	board configure
	---------------
	1. choose: 2:DDR 800Mbps
	2. choose: 1:Change to 2.1G
	3. choose: 1:Normal Boot
	
	come into "burn menu"
	--------------------
	1. choose: [b] EBL
	
	burn dtb, kernel Image and rootfs into NAND flash of P660 test board
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. ifconfig -s eth0 [IP.address] [mask] [gateway]
	2. provision [server.IP] -u [name] -p [passwd] -f hisi_p660_evb_32core.dtb -a 0x06000000
	3. provision [server.IP] -u [name] -p [passwd] -f Image -a 0x80000
	4. provision [server.IP] -u [name] -p [passwd] -f filesystem.cpio.gz -a 0x07000000
	5. exit
	6. choose: [d] ESL Start OS to start kernel
	

	If you want to update the UEFI for the board, you can use following commands

	burn uefi:
	---------
	provision [server.IP] -u [name] -p [passwd] -f PV660_EFI_L1_EVBa_TC.fd -a 0x06000000
	wfmem 0x06000000 0x0 0x100000

	Note:
	The contents in the parentheses should be replaced according to the actual
	conditions.
