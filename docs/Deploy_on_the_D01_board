***** Deploy on the D01 Board *****

1. Purpose
================

  This document describes how to build some files by Estuary tools v0.2, and
  also record the process of booting D01 board using those files.


2. Preparative
================

(1) Build FTP server in local host 

  We need to build FTP server in local host to communicate with D01 board
  whatever the system of local host is Windows or Ubuntu. For Ubuntu system it
  can download, compile and burn codes directly, but for Windows system it needs
  another server which is linux to compile source codes at first, and then
  transfer it to local host. 

  If local host system is Windows, what we should do is to set names and
  passwords of user, and directory of sharing files after installing software
  wftp32.  

(2) Build DHCP and TFTP server 

  PXE boot is built upon DHCP and TFTP server. So if we want to boot with PXE,
  DHCP and TFTP server should be set up at our local network. Refer to these
  to set up DHCP server and TFTP server on Ubuntu:
    https://wiki.linaro.org/Boards/D01/PXE. 

  But on Windows what we have to do is to install and set software tftp32.
 

3. Deploying
================
 
(1)	Get the whole project and initialize it according to chapter 4 of README. 

(2)	Run the scripts build.sh to build files we need 

	./tools/build.sh –p D01 –d Ubuntu 

	Note: D01 is the platform that can run those built files, and Ubuntu is
          the distribution which will run on D01 board.

	After that there is a folder named build on current directory, and a
	folder named D01 in build folder. Under the D01 folder there are file
	folders: distro, grub2, linux, toolchain, uefi. The distribution is under
	the distro, grub files exit under the grub2, compiled source codes of
	kernel lay under the linux, cross-compiled toolchain is under the
    toolchain, EFI-BOOT.fd is under the ufei.  

(3)	Create folder structure under your TFTP root path 

  1) The distribution under distro
	 We should copy the distribution to the sharing directory of FTP server,
	 and the distribution will be transferred to D01 board’s disk which will
	 be mounted to some file on D01. D01 board will boot the distribution from
     disk.  

  2) zImage/hip04-d01-dtb/grub.efi 
     create folder structure under your tftp root patha as follow:
		| -- zImage
		| -- hip04-d01.dtb
		| -- efi
			  | -- grub.efi
			  | -- lib/grub/arm-efi
			  | -- grub.cfg
 
	 NOTES: zImage and hip04-d01.dtb come from the file folder linux, and
			grub.efi comes from the file folder grub2. The context on file
            grub.cfg must looks like: 
				set timeout=3
				# By default, boot the D01 kernel
				set default=D01
				# For booting GNU/Linux
				menuentry "D01-Linux" --id D01 { 
					devicetree hip04-d01.dtb 
					linux zImage console=ttyS0,115200 root=/dev/sdb1
                          rootfstype=ext4 rw earlyprintk ip=dhcp
					# linux zImage console=ttyS0 earlyprintk root=/dev/sda1
					#     rootfstype=ext4 rw
				}
   3) Rename file D01.fd to EFI-BOOT.fd, and put it on FTP sharing directory

(4)	Upgrade UEFI to support PXE boot 

	Press “s” until UEFI menu appears after rebooting D01 board. Select “b”
    and enter into command line pattern. Set IP address as follow: 

		ifconfig -s eth0 192.168.10.142 255.255.255.0 192.168.10.1

	load UEFI which supports PXE boot: 

		provision 192.168.10.38 -u xc -p 123456789 -f  UEFI-BOOT.fd 
		updateL1 EFI-BOOT.fd modify 

	boot parameters to make D01 board boot from sda1: 

		changelinuxatag 
		console=ttyS0,115200 root=/dev/sda1 rootfstype=ext4 rw earlyprink setlinuxatag 

(5)	Reboot D01 board, and press “s” to enter UEFI menu. 

    Input these commands in turn:
		a	// Boot Manager
		1	// Add Boot Device Entry
		3	// PXE on MAC Address: ...
		PXE // Description for this Entry
		5	// Return to main menu
		2	// PXE
 
	These will enable the board to download ‘grub2.efi’ and launch it, then in
	3 seconds, grub2 will download and boot linux.
