***** Deploy Estuary to D02 Board *****

1. Purpose
================

  This document describes how to create needed software componenets and deploy
  them to D02 with Estuary.

  D02 board is the community board made with Hisilicon P660 SoC. It can support
  maximum 2 SoCs. But many of them which is using by the community if 1 SoC
  version.


2. Preparative
================

* Setup FTP server in local host 

  You will need to set up a FTP server in local host for the board to download the
  software components.


3. Deploying
================
 
(1)	Get the whole project and initialize it according to chapter 4 of README. 

(2)	Run the scripts build.sh to build files we need 

	./tools/build.sh –p D02 –d OpenEmbedded 

	Note: D02 is the platform that can run those built files, and OpenEmbedded
          is the distribution which will run on D02 board.

	After that there is a folder named build on current directory, and a
	folder named D02 in build folder. Under the D02 folder there are file
	folders: distro, linux, toolchain, uefi. The distribution is under the
	distro, compiled source codes of kernel lay under the linux, cross-compiled
	toolchain is under the toolchain, PV660D02_B900_Release-0130.fd is under the ufei.  

(3) Burn the files into the D02 board and boot up

	Firstly, you should copy the files produced in the last part into the
	directory of the ftp sever. Then to burn these files, you can use the
	following commands.

	board configure
	---------------
	1. choose: 1:DDR 1600Mbps
	
	come into "burn menu"
	--------------------
	1. choose: [3] EBL
	
	Download dtb, kernel Image and rootfs into DDR RAM of P660 test board
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. ifconfig -s eth0 [IP.address] [mask] [gateway]
	2. provision [server.IP] -u [name] -p [passwd] -f hip05-d02.dtb -a 0x06000000
	3. provision [server.IP] -u [name] -p [passwd] -f Image -a 0x80000
	4. provision [server.IP] -u [name] -p [passwd] -f filesystem.cpio.gz -a 0x07000000
	5. exit
	6. choose: [d] ESL Start OS to start kernel
	

	If you want to update the UEFI for the board, you can use following commands

	burn uefi:
	---------
	provision [server.IP] -u [name] -p [passwd] -f PV660D02_B900_Release.fd -a 100000
	spiwfmem 100000 0000000 200000

	more burn UEFI\trustfw information, please refer to ./build/D02/binary/readme after building your system.

	Note:
	The contents in the parentheses should be replaced according to the actual
	conditions.
